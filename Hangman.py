'''
problem: 
A word guessing game of hangman will be played through simple user input. User will be prompted to guess a random word each time they run the game. Every wrong input of the letter would result in a subtraction of the user's life out of 10. once the user runs out of all 10 lives,  the game will show that the user has lost the game and will reveal the word the user was guessing. if the user guesses the word within the 10 chances they get, the game will show that the user has won.

plot twists - 
Though the user will not be able to play the word guessing game if their name has been left blank and if they are under the age of 18.

When guessing the word, if the user accidentally inputs anything other than a letter. a new loop would begin where they would have to guess the same word again with the remaining life they have left.
